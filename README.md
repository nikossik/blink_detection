## **Key Points**
1. Steps involved:
    1. Localize the face in the image
    2. Extract out the eyes landmarks
    3. Calculate EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio)
    4. Determine if the person is blinking.

2. **EAR** (Eye Aspect Ratio) formula:

The eye aspect ratio will remain approximately constant when the eyes are open
